        When I was entering the Games industry, I wanted to create something that 
        would stand out on my job application, and so I decided to create a short 
        video game all about me and my CV. The game, made with <b>Unity</b>, is easily accessible for anybody 
        and can be finished in a matter of minutes - you can even 
        <u><a href="/cv-game">play it</a></u> 
        on this website!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It was a challenge to find the right balance between easy and interesting for this 
        game: I know that recruiters often only spend a couple of minutes looking at each 
        application, so I needed the game to be playable in that time while also being 
        fun enough to get me hired! I put a lot of my personality into the game (through dialogue) 
        alongside descriptions of my skillset and experience to give employers a better 
        understanding of me and how I think about video games.

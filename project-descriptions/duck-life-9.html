        At <b>Wix Games</b>, I was an integral part of a small team that created <b>Duck Life 9: The Flock</b>  
        from the ground up. As one of three developers on the team, my responsibilities were many; they included: 
        programming in <b>Unity</b>;
        writing dialogue for over 100 unique NPC characters and cutscenes;
        UI programming within <b>Unity</b>;
        and architecting minigames single-handedly within <b>Unity</b> from open-ended briefs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The <b>Duck Life</b> series started out with a Flash 
        game on the web roughly fifteen years ago. It was a challenge to design a game that 
        appealed to the nostalgic sensibilities of our long-time fans while also offering a modern, 
        refreshing gameplay loop that stood up against present-day titles. I very much enjoyed 
        being a part of this unique project and we are all very proud of the end result!

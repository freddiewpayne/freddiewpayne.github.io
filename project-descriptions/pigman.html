        I created this game as a way of getting to grips with <b>Unreal Engine 5</b> and 
        the <b>Blueprint visual scripting</b> workflow. I first had the idea for the <b>Pigman</b> 
        game a couple of years before, when I created some assets and began development in 
        <b>Unity</b> - it was very interesting to compare how it went between the two game engines!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The idea I had was all about capturing the feeling of walking through an ancient woodland - 
        I have grown up near these forests and love the unique feeling of exploration and cosiness 
        that only they can provide. <b>Unreal's</b> suite of rendering tools, such as <b>Nanite</b> 
        and <b>Lumen</b>, gave me a great way to try and recreate this feeling with a cartoon 
        aesthetic. My environment design still has a long way to go, but should you wish you can 
        take a look at the project yourself <u><a href="https://freddiewpayne.itch.io/pigman-demo-unreal-5">here</a></u>.

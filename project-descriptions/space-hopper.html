        A little while ago, I became interested in hypercasual games (such as the 
        lengendary <b>Flappy Bird</b>) and thought it would be an interesting challenge 
        to create a game that can be immediately picked up and understood while 
        still being addictive and interesting. So, I designed <b>Space Hopper</b>, a 
        simple <b>mobile</b> game where you control an astronaut drifting through the cosmos.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can control the astronaut by holding a point on the screen that he will then 
        travel towards. However, he is also influenced by the gravity of the planetoids 
        and black holes around him, so you never quite have full control! This project taught me 
        a lot about <b>mobile development in Unity</b>, as well as working with my girlfriend 
        who created all of the game's artwork.
